# Functional Programming as a Paradigm Shift

Under this topic we attempted to answer a few questions and address a few
statements:

* Is the paradigm [of functional programming] too hard?
* Why do we assume that functional programming is a hard or major shift?
* How to introduce functional thinking [to new and experienced developers]
* Functional programming - a paradigm shift in thinking?
* Know all paradigms!

After a lot of spirited discussions, we concluded on:

**Paradigm is not too hard**

The wikipedia article on functional programming, as well as the focus on
lambda calculus creates an artificially high threshold for learning functional
programming (someone should update the wikipedia article :-) )

**Cooking an egg**

We kept coming back to example of cooking an egg. Usually you would think of
this as a series of instructions, including timing. However, with the
introduction of sous-vide cooking, the focus is more on what you want to
achieve (getting the egg to the right temperature) and not so much how you a
achieve it (boiling or sous vide).

**OO thinking is hard to unlearn**

Just as with the transition from procedural to OO programming was hard for
procedural programmers, the transition from OO to FP can be hard for OO
programmers. It may be easier to teach “fresh developers” FP, as they have
less things to unlearn. Using languages that allows for both OO and FP can
make the transition easier (such as Scala, Swift).

**Nomenclature**

FP has a different nomenclature from OO (and other paradigms). This creates an
artificial barriers that can be hard to overcome for developers transitioning
to FP:

* The use of transformations instead of mutations
* Recursions instead of iterations
