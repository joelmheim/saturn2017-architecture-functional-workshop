# Themes / Takeaways

Participants were asked "What was the most intereting thing you took away from the workshop?"

* How / What / Why:  Functional programming gets closest to "what".

* Focus on goal, now how it's accomplished.  Example of cooking egg sous vide vs boil for n minutes.

* Quality attributes of FP (Immutable Data / Referential Transparency / Functional Composition)

* FP transfers state management elsewhere.  State cannot be abstracted away.

* Non consensus on patterns.  Is "Functional Architecture" really a thing?

* The way FP is explained is a detractor.  This is bad, as it's more approachable than the Wikipedia page would suggest.  Still a lot of baggage and misconceptions about FP.

* Functional tactics have quality attribute tradeoffs.  There is not really a "functional architectural style" but there are "functional tactics".  These are often mixed with existing styles, just like the other tactics.

* FP helps with events and event-driven development.

* Architecture is always functional.

* Choice of programming language has a bigger impact on architecture than we realize -- beyond FP.

* Why now?  The push/pull model helps explain why it's increasingly popular now.

* Functional and Oo are not mutually exclusive.  Few pure OO or FP languages.
